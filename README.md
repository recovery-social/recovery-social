## Abstract

With the LSP11 - Social Recovery Contract a user is able to regain access after losing access to his/her UP.

To do that the user can add different guardians who vote for a his new address to regain access.

A user is able to add Guardians like family members or friends.
But a user donâ€™t just wants to have friends and family members as guardians.
Users should be able to authenticate themselves with 2FA, Social Logins or even Biometric Authenfication.

For this we created the LSP11 - Recovery Service Contract, which allows external operators to act as Guardians for the LSP 11 - Social Recovery in a standardized way.

With recovery.social, we offer a UI, which helps the user setup everything and interact with Recovery Services.

We also provide sample projects and docs on how to become a Recovery Service and how to communicate with the LSP11 - Recovery Service and recovery.social.

Our vision is to build an open ecosystem where anyone can build a Recovery Service. The user decides, which services he trusts to help recover his profile.
Because the number of guards (threshold), which are needed to recover, can be set individually a user don't has to trust one service alone. This makes the system very flexible and trustworthy.

# Recovery Services

## Abstract

This standard allows recovery services to provide a service to Universal Profile users to have them as an external guardian. The Recovery Service provides a method or multiple methods of Authentification for users. Universal Profile Users can setup the Authentification method with the Recovery Service and add them as a Recovery Service Guardian in their LSP11SocialRecovery.

The Recovery Service contract provides the most flexible and secure process, where the Recovery Service operator, if added as an guardian at the LSP11SocialRecovery, can vote to one address in each recoverProcessId.

The operator itself is able to let the user sign a transaction with a ticket provided by the Recovery Service Operator to vote, therefore the user pays for the gas.

The operator is able to define a price which has to be paid for the recovery process. When choosing a Recovery Service as a Guardian you will always be able to get the price which was set at that time.

The operator is also able to make a vote by himself, but has to cover the gas fees himself.
